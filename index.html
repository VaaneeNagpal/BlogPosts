<p> Monday welcomed the last week at the Hacker Exchange. The first week at the program was fascinating and full of sessions and workshops on entrepreneurship, lean startup, pitch training and networking with Venture Capitalists. The focus for this week was pitch preparation along with sessions on growth hacking and different approaches adapted based on the market size and visiting tech companies such as Google, Mixpanel, and Thunkable. 
In this blog, I would discuss and reflect upon how to plan marketing strategies to grow the business and advantages and disadvantages of seeking VC funding.
<p>Growth Hacking
This week commenced with the session by Guillaume Dumortier, the growth marketing specialist. The term growth marketing is defined can be defined as creating and planning marketing decision based on the company identity and offering across all marketing channels using modern age tools. The session was intense and jam-packed with information about the new age analytics tools to video length, frames per second, appropriate aspect ratio, etc.the top three takeaways from this session are -
<p>1. KFT Technique provides the fundamental information that a company should use to design marketing campaigns.
a) Know: The first few advertisements presented by the company is to let the audience Know who they are and what do they do;
b) Familiarity: This notion is applied in the second phase when the company has gained enough market size; staying Familiar with the target audience is significant.
c) Trust: A company must build and sustain continuous Trust among the audience.
<p>2.  Update with the market: The marketing techniques are continuously evolving. The marketing methods have changed from what they were a decade ago. Therefore, a company should be at the top of all the marketing channels and then analyze and select the channel based on the need. For example, in today's age and time, it is crucial for a company to have an online presence and actively use social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, etc.

<p>3. Why should people buy the product: Create advertisements which contain a benefit-centric message approach, i.e., highlight the reward customer would get by buying your product.

<p>VC Funding in the Valley

<p>Earlier this week, we met Luba Lesive, a venture capitalist in the Valley.
This session was incredibly insightful and one of my favorites, as it answered a significant question that every entrepreneur has, i.e., is VC funding good for my business? As an aspiring startup founder, I have always thought that getting VC funding is necessary to build and grow a business. However, that is not precisely true. Sure, attaining VC funding boosts the hyper-expansion of the company, provides a valuable source of guidance and consultation and aid in financial managenment, etc. This might also lead to expediting the process for a startup to become a unicorn company. Nevertheless, the question is, should you get VC funding and are you ready for it?
<p>I didn't get the chance to meet Chris Sacca, but I was able to connect professionally with people like Nathan Gold, Viki Forrest (CEO ANZA Technology Network),  Jon Baer (Co-Author of Decoding Silicon Valley), Ryan MacCarrigan (Lean Startup Coach), John Ngoi(Tech Lead at PG&E), etc. 
<p>Obtaining VC funding is not all green. Luba revealed that a venture capitalist usually makes ten investments out of which the probability of the success of its investment is 10%, i.e., 9/10 investments fail. Therefore, the pressure on the company increases as it succeeds. Since the one company that would achieve would be the one proffering the return on investment more than the total expenditure made by the venture capitalist in all its investments. Moreover, VC try to take a big chunk of the business before investing as they want to establish control over the company. Therefore, it is evident that a startup should firstly access whether it has the potential to become a unicorn and is it well prepared for rapid expansion as VC's want companies to act fast and produce results as well as they root for big wins.
