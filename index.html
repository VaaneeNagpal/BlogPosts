<p> This blog is the last blog of the Hacker Exchange Journey reflection series. I would discuss the next set of questions and reflect on them as well as talk about the skills obtained during the program and how have I been using them after the program.
<p>Pre-Reflection Questionnaire
<p>1. What aspect of the program are you most anxious/scared/ worried about?
At this stage, my idea is premature; therefore I believe it takes a lot of work for me to pitch to a VC's and Hacker Exchange faculty. Moreover, I am a little anxious about how would people react to it and if I would be able to pitch the idea in the final round.

<p>2. Who would you like most to meet and why? (Who is in your ideal “elevator”?)
Well as we all know Silicon Valley is the tech startup hub; thus there are multiple people I would like to meet. However, my first choice would be Chris Sacca as he is a reputed angel investor at Silicon Valley who majorly invests in the new upcoming technology. In addition to this, he has headed teams at Google, is the founder of venture capital fund as well as appeared on one of my favorite show named Shark Tank which shows that he has a robust network of individuals.

<p>3. What strategies are you going to use to ensure you make the most of this program?
I have come up with the top three strategies that I am going to implement which are
	a) Listen more, speak less;
	b) Participate in the interactive sessions, take part in group discussions don't hesitate to clear any doubts;
	c) Attend networking events and create robust professional contacts with other participants, mentors, etc.

<p>Post-Reflection

<p>At the beginning of the program, I was extremely nervous about my business idea; therefore due to apprehension, I was unable to explain my concept correctly to people. Thus, most of the people were confused, and as a result, they dismissed it. Jeannette Cheah(the founder of Hacker Exchange/mentor), Chris Hoffman(mentor)  and Nathan Gold(pitch coach), assisted me in organizing and expressing my thoughts through pitch notes, listened to multiple iterations of my pitch and provided constructive feedback. 

<p>I didn't get the chance to meet Chris Sacca, but I was able to connect professionally with people like Nathan Gold, Viki Forrest (CEO ANZA Technology Network),  Jon Baer (Co-Author of Decoding Silicon Valley), Ryan MacCarrigan (Lean Startup Coach), John Ngoi(Tech Lead at PG&E), etc. 

<p>All the strategies mentioned above enhanced my experience at the program as well as helped me attain skills such as resilience, self-reliance, personal branding, relationship building, and strategy formulation.
<p>Thus, Hacker Exchange has not only introduced me to new paths and professional connections but also gave me an opportunity to grow my skillset with skills that can be executed in every professional capacity.
