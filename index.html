<p> In the last week since the trip, Iâ€™ve been reflecting on the journey and working out the next steps for my startup idea. In the future three blog posts, I will discuss my answers to the pre-reflection questionnaire and reflect on those post the trip. The blogs would highlight my initial expectations, the knowledge gained during the program and progress made since the last blog. Below is the script of the four questions from the pre-reflection questionnaire provided by the program.

Pre-reflections
Hacker Exchange provided the participants with a set of 10 questions before the trip which requested standard information about the expectations from the program, collaboration with other participants and the startup idea. 

1. Why did you choose this program?
I have always been an entrepreneur at heart. I had my first startup when I was ten years old. I had a lemonade stall at city fest where I donated the money earned to a blind school. Additionally, I was actively involved in the university program TechLauncher which has motivated me to give my startup idea a push. Therefore, with this program, I saw an opportunity to start my own business and gain valuable insights about entrepreneurship from the best mentors at Silicon Valley. Moreover, TechLauncher has provided me with business values and a basic understanding of the technical side of things required to build and sustain a startup. Therefore, I believe with Hacker Exchange I can enhance my knowledge set and bring my idea to reality.

2. What is the main thing you hope to achieve?
I hope by the end of the program I would be able to organize my idea and start working on the prototype. None the less, I want to enhance my current knowledge set by acquiring skills that I can utilize with the further projects.

3. What are you most looking forward to?
I am looking forward to getting valuable and constructive feedback from the mentors and VC's involved with the program. I opine this would not only shape my idea but also help me pivot if necessary. 

4. What particular skill would you like to develop during this program?
I want to learn and acquire the skill of pitching an idea. I believe it is necessary to correctly word the thoughts and ideas as the information gained within the first few seconds of the pitch determine whether people would invest their time or money into the startup.

Post Reflection
Hacker Exchange is one of a kind program as the content learned during the program is delivered by the industry specialist. Moreover, the mentors and the visiting faculty present unique hands-on activities that have genuinely helped me to organize my thoughts into a clear and concise form. Furthermore, it gave me an opportunity to meet like-minded people who are driven to learn and innovate. 

Since the end of the program, I have started working on the prototype for my startup idea along with the technical advisor to whom I met at one of networking event at San Francisco. The program has exceeded my expectations as after completing the program I have not only created a valuable network but also gained insights to the startup hub - the Silicon Valley.

Next Blog
The next blog would cover a different set of questions from the pre-reflection questionnaire followed by the post-reflection.
