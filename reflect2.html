<p>In the previous blog, I discussed the part of questions from the pre-reflection questionnaire provided by Hacker Exchange before the program start date. Following the last blog, I would address the next set of questions from the pre-reflection questionnaire as well as reflect on my answers.  
<p>Pre-Reflection Questionnaire
<p>1. How do you think this program will influence your business idea?
Expectedly, by the end of the program, I shall be able to pitch my idea and create a valuable network of people that can help me bring my concept to reality or make useful introductions if necessary. Moreover, I hope to learn about the entrepreneurship principles, the USA startup industry, funding, marketing channels, mentor feedback, etc. and apply the knowledge gained, and the feedback received from the mentors and the faculty into my startup project.

<p>2.  What do you think you can offer to other students in this program?
As a software engineering student, I believe I can help fellow entrepreneurs with technical advice about the development process, technical resources, and tools required, etc. Moreover, I can act as a bouncing board if a participant wants to brainstorm as well as listen to their pitches and provide constructive feedback.

<p>3. Currently, what are your greatest strengths and areas for improvement?
My biggest strength is my audacity and persuasive communication. I have never refrained myself from reaching out to someone. I have always believed in building and sustaining connections with people, and that has held good for me so far.
My biggest weakness/ area of improvement has to be my habit of procrastination due to which I have been in the situation when I felt under a hammer as I didn't organize my workload accurately. However, now I have started managing my time by creating a bespoke daily planner which includes writing the motivation for the day, schedules, goals (things I want to achieve apart from my mundane schedule), etc.

<p>Post-Reflection

<p>I got an opportunity to be mentored by one of the best pitch coaches in the Silicon Valley named Nathan Gold. He not only shared his golden rule of how to hook and bait the audience but also provided constructive criticism that helped me deliver a successful pitch. I was one of the top four students at the Hacker Exchange final pitch session where all the participants pitched their ideas to the VC's and accelerator mentors at the Silicon Valley.

<p>I supported to fellow participants in creating final powerpoint presentation as well as listening to their pitches and providing valuable feedback. In addition to this, fellow participants such as Will Parker helped me in reviewing the official contract with the technical advisor, and John Forbes aided me in preparation for the final pitch round. 

<p>My biggest strength was my audacity and confidence. I was always keen on getting feedback from different people; this helped me in structuring my ideas and views as well as growing my network. However, my biggest weakness was getting distracted from the fundamental concept while pitching my startup idea to new people. I was able to tackle this issue with the help of Nathan Gold who advised me to create pitch notes in the form of short points instead of memorizing the whole pitch.

<p>Next Blog
<p>The next blog is the third part of the trip reflection in which I would discuss and reflect on the last few questions from the pre-reflection questionnaire. Additionally, I will discuss the skills acquired during the program.
